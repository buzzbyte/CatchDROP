CatchDROP
=========

A simple game where you try to catch as many raindrops as you can with a bucket. If you miss one the game is over. Made in Java using libGDX.

Download
--------
Binaries for this project are downloadable at [this page](https://github.com/buzzbyte/CatchDROP/releases). APKs will soon be available.

Needless to say, but Java is required to be installed to run this game on desktop.

HTML version not working?
-----------------
Yes, I know. It doesn't support the font library that I'm using for this game. I've created a separate version of the game as a replacement for the broken version. I'll post the source as a separate repo once I find it.

Issues, help, and suggestions
-----------------------------
