{"name":"CatchDROP","tagline":"Catch all the raindrops!!","body":"CatchDROP\r\n=========\r\n\r\nA simple game made in Java using libGDX. The goal of this game is to catch as many raindrops as you can by dragging the bucket left or right. If one drop hits the ground, it's game over.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this game came from a tutorial I found on the [libGDX Wiki](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki). I followed the tutorial and expanded the game using my own resources instead of the ones in the tutorial. The purpose of this is really to learn more and gain more experience about game programming and also it's for fun, of course!\r\nI hope you'll enjoy it! I will hopefully keep updating it and release it when it's ready.\r\n\r\nI'll add screenshots later..","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
